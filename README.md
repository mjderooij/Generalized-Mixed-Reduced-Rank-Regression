# Generalized-Mixed-Reduced-Rank-Regression

This repository contains functions and scripts for the paper entitled "Reduced Rank Regression for Mixed Predictor and Response Variables". 

The functions are:
1. gmr3.R
2. fit.gmr3.R
3. predict.gmr3.R
4. boot.gmr3.R
5. xval.gmr3.R
6. auxiliary.gmr3.R
7. plot.boot.gmr3.R
8. plot.xval.gmr3.R


The scripts are:
1. read_data.R
2. analysis.R

For the scripts to run properly, first you need to obtain the data from the the website of the European Union https:
//europa.eu/eurobarometer/screen/home. The file code needed is ZA7953. 

The script analysis.R reproduces the analysis described in the manuscript. 

For the simulation study the scripts are:
1. simstudy.R
2. rrr.sim3a.R
3. rrr.sim3b.R
